# Zoo
The idea of this application is to serve the staff of an Imaginary Zoo. Once logged in a member of the staff can:
- Basic user:
    - add new animals (unique name, species, origin, birthday, special diet, health status...)
    - search information about animals based on the unique name
    - add a medical record (with timestamp and who wrote the message) concerning animal care
    - see the medical records concerning a specific animal
- Admin:
    - all basic user rights
    - add new staff members (existing names are allowed)
    - add new app users (new application users are basic users by default, username is unique)

There are few origin countries, species and diagnoses in the seed.sql, but in real life all possible countries/species/diagnoses
would be included in the database.

Medical records (el√§intietokanta):
- The names of the animals are unique, so you search using names
- User must know the name

You can use the provided seed.sql to create:
- initial admin user with username, password = admin, admin
- two basic users with username, password = "Hanna Hoituri", hannahoituri and "Kalle Kalamies", kallekalamies
- some data into needed tables.

Future development ideas:
- when searching animal information, choose animal name from a list?
- unique identifiers for animals (like "social security number") and staff members
- enable editing medical records

How to use:

Clone this repository into your own computer and locate its root directory. Create .env -file and add following information:

- DATABASE_URL=<local-database-location>
- SECRET_KEY=<secret-key>

Next, activate the virtual environment and install the dependencies for the application with commands:
- $ python3 -m venv venv
- $ source venv/bin/activate
- $ pip install -r ./requirements.txt

Define database scheme with command:
- $ psql < schema.sql

Input data into tables with command:
- $ psql < seed.sql

Now you can start the application with command:
- $ flask run
