# Zoo
The idea of this application is to serve the staff of an imaginary Zoo. Once logged in a member of the staff can manipulate the database to for example:
- add new animals (species, origin, name, birthday, special diet, health status...)
- search information about animals based on name, species, origin..
- add a message (with timestamp and who wrote the message) concerning animal care, for example "Ben the bear was fed and given antibiotics"
- see the messages concerning a specific animal
- browse messages with certain keywords or dates
- add new staff members as users to the application
- ...

The app could include also for example food/supply stock etc. but it might may get too large for the course purposes?
